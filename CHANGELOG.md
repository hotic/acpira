# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Codex (`codex-acp`, the official `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` adapter) and Claude (`claude-agent-acp`, `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`) are built-in agents with install, login and extension entries. A user-defined `acpira.agents.codex` / `.claude` entry still overrides the built-in.
- The agent settings page shows the adapter package version and its bundled engine version (read off npm `package.json` files, the CLI is never launched), an active engine-override variable (`CODEX_PATH` / `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`) with its value, and the last launch stage — `spawn_failed` / `handshake_failed` / `auth_required` / `ready` — from probes and real session starts.
- `type: 'terminal'` ACP auth methods are supported: the client advertises `clientCapabilities.auth.terminal` and runs the method's binary + args in a host terminal instead of calling `authenticate` (Claude's `claude-ai-login` / `console-login`, pi-acp's `pi_terminal_login`). An agent can opt out (`acpira.agents.<id>.terminalAuth`); the Devin built-in does — its ACP process ignores a locally written login.
- Boolean ACP config options render as switches (Codex `fast-mode`) and send a real boolean to `session/set_config_option`.
- Permission cards show the adapter's own title / reason from `_meta.permission` (Codex "Run command?", Claude's "Ready to code?"), offer quick Allow / Reject buttons picked by option kind, and emphasize the reject button when the adapter flags `defaultToNo`.
- Agent-emitted images render inline in the transcript (click for the lightbox; the agent's saved path is an openable caption) and export as file links in Markdown exports.
- Plan-mode approval is recognized for Codex (the `switch_mode` "Implement this plan?" review) and Claude (ExitPlanMode), linking the plan document to its permission card.

### Changed

- Agent-managed terminal output (Codex's `_meta.terminal_output_delta`, Claude's `_meta.terminal_*`) streams into the tool row as plain text; a completed command's `{ formatted_output, exit_code }` receipt no longer renders as raw JSON.
- Modes tagged `full_access` by the adapter (Codex / Claude) keep their own name but carry the warning glyph in the mode picker.

### Planned

- MCP server injection from Acpira settings remains planned. Agents still read their own CLI MCP config.
- Steer / interrupt follow-up modes remain planned. Mid-turn messages stay in the host-side queue.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- OpenCode (`opencode acp`), DSH (`dsh --profile acp`) and Pi (`pi-acp`) are built-in agents with install and login entries. Pi needs both `pi` and `pi-acp` on the PATH; a missing helper command is named on the agent's settings page.
- The history list's Import button lists an agent's own native sessions for the current project and imports one into Acpira, replaying its history through `session/load`. Listing runs only `initialize` and `session/list` in a short-lived process and never creates a native session; already imported sessions open their local copy. An agent that can resume but not load (DSH) continues the session without replayed history and says so.
- Subagents get their own transcript, lifecycle and inspector instead of being flattened into the parent conversation: Devin's nested subagents, Kimi's Agent tool and `claude-agent-acp` child sessions (as a custom agent). The announcing turn shows compact rows, the inspector docks beside the thread at wide widths or overlays it, permission and question cards stay with the subagent that asked, and a session-wide summon graph, opened from a composer chip or the inspector, drills into any node. Children still running when the parent finishes are marked disconnected rather than failed. Custom agents that reject unknown client capabilities can opt out with `subagents: false` in `acpira.agents`.
- Agents can be reordered by drag or Alt+↑/↓ and switched off in the settings navigation (`acpira.agentOrder`, `acpira.disabledAgents`). Every list follows the same order; switched-off agents leave the new-session menu, the default-agent picker and the import picker while their existing sessions keep working, and the last enabled agent cannot be switched off.
- Text attachment previews render Markdown for `.md` files and Markdown-looking text, with a toggle back to the source.
- Vendor marks for z.ai, OpenCode and Pi; DSH, GLM / Zhipu, Llama and ChatGPT models reuse their parent brand's mark.

### Changed

- The process fold opens with the Working indicator from the first moment of a turn, so early thoughts read as its children, and a turn that ends with no process retires the fold with a fade. Process rows play their entrance once per tool rather than again when a tool changes shape.
- Streamed text is revealed at the measured arrival rate: a burst after a stall plays at the running speed instead of all at once, cut points avoid half-typed Markdown syntax, and the glyph fade keeps CJK line breaking intact.
- The person icon in the header is account-only: Devin's stored logins or Grok / Kimi's official account, hidden for agents without an account layer. New sessions of another agent start from the plus menu.
- Model settings combine search, the master switch and disclosure in one card, list newer releases first and collapse catalogs beyond ten model families.
- Native model parameters (`model_config`) sit below reasoning in the model picker, and an active Fast option appears in the model label.
- Mode, effort and Fast picks show immediately instead of waiting for the agent's confirmation; rapid picks collapse to the last value and a refused pick reverts to the agent's state.
- DeepSeek Harness is displayed as DSH.
- Tighter spacing between conversation turns and around the composer; cards docked above the composer keep a gap below them.

### Fixed

- A turn that ends with no output and no error from the CLI shows a retryable empty-response error instead of a blank reply. Slash command receipts and tool-only turns are unaffected.
- Follow-up messages sent during a running turn or automatic compaction stay visible below the compaction in send order, and the send button remains available for them.
- Forking a long conversation compacts the handed-over history (clipped tool output and plan documents, oldest turns omitted with a note) instead of refusing it, and a trim or real failure gets its own notice.
- Changing only the Devin Fusion sidekick keeps the lead model's reasoning level.
- A skill installed under both `~/.agents/skills` and `~/.claude/skills` appears once in slash command completion.
- Reasoning level controls no longer appear among the model visibility switches in agent settings.
- Restoring a session distinguishes gone, locked, read-only and retryable failures from the agent's error message instead of treating every invalid-parameter error as a vanished session.
- OpenCode edits keep their file diff when a permission request arrives late, and new files written by OpenCode show an all-added diff. Pi's startup banner no longer appears as a message, and its shell output streams into the tool card.
- Agents that do not accept embedded context receive dropped text attachments as delimited text, and image attachments are refused with a notice when an agent does not support images.
- Agent startup gives up after 30 seconds instead of waiting indefinitely.
- The folded prompt frame shrinks together with its fold instead of leaving an empty strip.
- The composer keeps the same height whether or not the context usage ring is shown, across agents and after a model switch.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Finished agent replies offer Markdown copy, fork-from-reply and a response statistics card. Statistics include the model, duration, tool calls and the token counts, model rounds, context snapshot and request ID available from the CLI; unreported usage is omitted.
- Fork an ACP conversation at a finished reply into a new session with the same agent, account and project. The copied transcript and attachments become retained context on the fork's first prompt; the original conversation stays unchanged, and the fork title remains available for manual renaming.
- Session menus in the header and list group the applicable rename, pin, move, open-in-editor and delete actions. Native ACP sessions can export Markdown or JSON to `~/.acpira/exports/`, with the exported file opened in the editor.
- Opt-in ChatGPT conversation mirrors through an explicit project-bound local bridge. The Connect ChatGPT Session command and Settings → ChatGPT → Desktop Commander provide connection instructions; the packaged bridge records explicitly forwarded visible messages, streaming command output, guarded file edits and completion receipts without starting an ACP agent. Calls outside the bridge are not captured automatically, and remote send, model-switch and stop controls are unavailable.

### Changed

- The context usage panel shows exact localized token counts and marks the auto-compaction threshold on the native window bar. Threshold state and limitations remain available in tooltips, with retained-history estimates kept separate from reported context usage.
- ChatGPT setup stays in external-integration settings and out of the launchable-agent and default-agent menus. Existing mirrors remain available in session history and channel filtering; local component detection, cloud pairing and observed project activity are reported separately.
- Metadata separators follow the interface language across tool details, account labels and composer controls.

### Fixed

- Refreshing an agent's settings re-reads model and reasoning options through a fresh ACP probe and renews its warm process. CLI configuration changes appear without creating a conversation; a failed probe preserves the last known options.
- ChatGPT mirror replay deduplicates event retries, keeps late tool output on its original turn and resumes observation without re-executing commands. Empty or stale mirrors report awaiting messages or unknown remote state, and source cancellation does not claim to terminate local processes.
- The published VSIX includes the ChatGPT bridge setup and limitations guide referenced by the integration.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-16

Unpublished development snapshot; shipped as part of 1.4.0.

### Changed

- ChatGPT is configured as an external integration in settings, with a Desktop Commander section, not listed as a launchable agent in the plus menu or default-agent picker. Historical ChatGPT sessions remain filterable.
- Local component/process detection is kept separate from cloud pairing and project message receipts. Unknown pairing is never reported as paired or unpaired from configuration artifacts alone.
- Follow-ups can explicitly supersede an unfinished observation without inventing a completion. Transport retries are idempotent by turn ID, late tool receipts stay with their original turn, and resuming observation never re-executes commands.
- Empty mirrors report awaiting their first message. Unobserved turns/tools show unknown state without continued execution timers or a success receipt. Stopping source generation does not claim termination of local processes.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-16

Unpublished development snapshot; shipped as part of 1.4.0.

### Added

- Opt-in **ChatGPT** session mirrors: a separate external channel reuses the existing conversation history, tool cards, output/diff display, pinning and project scope without starting Codex or an ACP process.
- `Acpira: Connect ChatGPT Session` opens a project-bound mirror and copies connection instructions. The VSIX includes a local `chatgpt-bridge.cjs` CLI for visible messages, streaming command execution, guarded file edits and explicit completion receipts.
- Cross-host mirror persistence, idempotent event replay and stale-connection indicators. Unobserved completion, hidden reasoning and unsupported remote controls are not synthesized. See `docs/chatgpt-bridge.md` for the explicit-binding boundary and limits.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- `Acpira: Open in New Window` command and view title action open a chat editor tab straight into a new VS Code window; each invocation makes another floating window.
- The session list can dock beside the conversation (`acpira.sessionListPosition`, collapsed by default); narrow panels open it as a drawer on the selected side, and its agent filter is a searchable channel picker instead of a chip row.
- The account quota display shows Devin's reported on-demand USD balance under the quota windows, including explicit zero and negative balances.

### Changed

- The mode picked in the composer (Code / Plan / Bypass Permissions, …) is remembered per agent like the model and comes back on the agent's next new session. Only manual picks count: a mode the agent switches by itself stays with that conversation.
- Slash commands complete and highlight mid-sentence like `@` mentions: a `/` at the start or after whitespace opens the list, and every advertised `/name` token keeps its accent pill in the composer and in the sent prompt, not just a leading one.
- Editing or resending a prompt keeps the live native session when the conversation allows it: an unchanged resend after turns that only failed or cancelled empty, and an edit whose rebuilt history would exceed the context budget, continue on the same peer with changed model / mode / config picks applied, instead of replaying the transcript into a fresh session.
- Read and search file result rows no longer carry a raw-output toggle; the file list is the whole presentation.

### Fixed

- A context-length error parks the queued prompts and its alert offers Compact context instead of a blind retry; when the agent has not advertised `/compact`, it suggests shortening the message or starting a new conversation.
- Reloading the window settles persisted in-flight turns as cancelled instead of reviving them: streams, background tools and approvals no longer appear live, and a late prompt result from a disposed process cannot overwrite the settled turn.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- IntelliJ Remote Development support: the conversation UI runs in JetBrains Client while the sidecar, agent CLIs, settings and project access run on the remote host. File links open remote files at the requested line; directory links select the directory in the project tree.
- Text attachment previews for drafts and conversation history. Large pasted text becomes an attachment, and file attachments in messages open in the editor.
- Devin Fusion model controls group lead model, reasoning effort, sidekick and Fast options into one model picker.
- Reconnect action for requests that repeatedly fail over a live agent connection, preserving the native session and its selected settings.

### Changed

- JetBrains Marketplace uses one universal plugin package with Node.js runtimes for all six supported OS and CPU combinations. Each backend selects its own runtime, including when the client runs on another platform. Smaller platform-specific archives remain available on GitHub.
- Context usage consistently reflects the agent-reported model window; retained history estimates and the automatic-compaction threshold are shown separately.
- The live plan overlays the conversation without shrinking its scroll area. Animation is a single on/off setting; working indicators continue rotating in both modes.

### Fixed

- JCEF loads correctly in 2026.2 and later Clients while retaining 2026.1 compatibility through separate browser adapters.
- Grok context polling continues through quiet streaming intervals; Kimi's delayed usage update is considered before queued prompts and automatic compaction. Context usage refreshes after background compaction completes.
- Session actions remain targeted to their original conversation, concurrent views share one session load, and new sessions use the agent's default mode. Restore failures retain actionable error states, and continuing in a new session keeps the selected agent.
- Long conversations avoid continuous shimmer repainting and excessive repaint work when process folds open. Pre-tool content remains visible during folding, streaming thoughts follow their own scroll tail, and file links wrapped in inline code remain clickable.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-10

This release includes the IntelliJ support prepared in 1.2.0 and the following updates since the last stable GitHub Release, 1.1.2. JetBrains Marketplace availability remains subject to review.

### Added

- IntelliJ IDEA support for 2026.1 and later, with the shared conversation UI in a tool window and editor tabs, IDE terminal logins and installs, project-indexed `@` file search, persistent settings, and live theme updates. Six macOS, Windows, and Linux packages cover ARM64 and x86-64, each with a bundled Node.js 22 runtime.
- Stable GitHub Releases build and attach the IntelliJ packages with SHA-256 checksums and submit all six variants to JetBrains Marketplace, alongside VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX publication.
- Agent-provided slash commands and skills appear in the composer with keyboard completion and argument hints, including history and queued-message editors. Known CLI descriptions and hints support Chinese search; custom descriptions and command names remain unchanged.

### Changed

- Recognized slash-command tokens are highlighted in the composer and sent prompts. Empty command responses explain that the CLI returned no text; mode and option changes are shown only when observed in the agent's state updates.
- Session scope is configured on the General settings page instead of chips in the session list. Inner thought, plan, diff, terminal, and question regions continue scrolling the conversation when they reach an edge.

### Fixed

- Switching accounts, reconnecting, and resending unchanged messages after empty failures preserve the native session and its compacted context. A replaced CLI process can no longer mark the new connection as failed.
- Concurrent VS Code, Cursor, and IntelliJ windows preserve each other's shared accounts, rotated secrets, and per-agent preferences. Continuous streaming periodically saves the transcript and reconciles the session list instead of postponing writes until streaming stops.
- Plan approvals and subsequent replies stay below their plan card. Out-of-order plan-file updates retain the existing approval, and unchanged completed to-do snapshots no longer reappear in follow-up replies or restored history.
- First-time diff expansion moves syntax highlighting off the UI thread and omits leading and trailing omission rows. Restored sticky prompts fold before the first paint, and the composer toolbar keeps its height as context usage appears or disappears.
- Dismissed context cards stay closed, and manually opened process folds stay open while messages stream.
- Permission and question answers remain attached to their originating session when the active view changes. Session and attachment paths reject invalid IDs and symlinks outside their storage roots; the browser harness requires its handshake token and a local origin.
- IntelliJ sidecar startup serializes view attachment and message delivery, rejects stale process callbacks, and stops repeated restart failures. Windows resource paths remain slash-separated, and IDE settings survive an application restart.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- IntelliJ IDEA plugin (2026.1 and later). The same conversation UI, sessions, accounts and settings as the extension, hosted in a tool window and in editor tabs, with the agent CLIs driven by a Node.js sidecar. Terminal logins and installs open an IDE terminal, `@` file search uses the project index, the theme follows the IDE live, and settings persist in the IDE. Distributed as one zip per OS and CPU (`acpira-<version>-<os>-<arch>.zip`, six variants) with a bundled Node.js 22 runtime; `ACPIRA_NODE` or a Node ≥ 22 on the shell `PATH` is used when no bundled runtime fits.
- Stable GitHub Releases also build the plugin zips, attach them to the Release and upload them to the JetBrains Marketplace.

### Changed

- The taglines describe the agent CLIs as harnesses and no longer present Acpira as a VS Code product.
- The session list no longer shows session-scope chips; the scope is set on the General settings page (`acpira.sessionScope`) only.
- Scrollable regions inside a message (thoughts, plans, diffs, terminal output, questions) hand the wheel back to the conversation once they reach their end instead of trapping it.

### Fixed

- Switching accounts or retrying keeps the agent's native session: the replacement CLI is re-authenticated and resumes the same session instead of replaying the transcript into a new one, so Devin's compacted context is not lost and the old process exiting no longer marks the session as failed.
- VS Code, Cursor and IntelliJ sidecars that share `~/.acpira` edit `accounts.json`, `secrets.json` and `sessions/prefs.json` under a file lock, so an account removed in one window is not resurrected by another and a preference write only replaces its own agent's entry.
- The context usage card stays closed after being dismissed; a process fold opened by hand stays open when the message is rebuilt during streaming.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Agent availability tests no longer assume Grok, Devin, and Kimi are already installed, so a clean CI runner matches a developer machine. 1.1.1's GitHub Release did not finish marketplace publication.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Settings now has an Appearance page: follow the VS Code theme or pin light/dark, UI and code font sizes, color vs +/- diff markers, font smoothing, and motion.
- Missing agent CLIs are detected live (poll while missing, re-check on focus) instead of staying grey until a reload. The agent page offers a one-line install, a terminal run, and a docs link; custom agents can declare `acpira.agents.<id>.install`.
- Official Grok and Kimi CLI quota is shown next to the local login without importing it as a switchable account. Remaining share and reset countdown sit on colored tubes.
- The session list is scoped to the current workspace by default (`acpira.sessionScope`). Under All, rows from other projects show the folder name and a "move here" action; a running session refuses the move.
- Workspace paths in markdown and inline code open in the editor, including `file://` links and `#L` line targets.
- Code diffs keep syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a copy control. Highlighting waits until the output is visible.
- Confirmed Grok and Kimi todo-tool results render as a plan list in the conversation, without replacing the live to-do dock.

### Changed

- Sessions, accounts, and secrets now live in `~/.acpira` (override with `ACPIRA_HOME`) instead of VS Code `globalStorage` and SecretStorage. Existing data is copied once on first launch; the previous location is left untouched. Secrets are stored in `secrets.json` (mode 600), not the OS keychain. VS Code and Cursor share the directory, so opening the other IDE still brings its sessions and accounts along.
- Auto `/compact` now runs after a turn ends and again before the next user-facing prompt when usage is still over the threshold. The context panel shows the agent window, the budget marker, and that compact waits for the next message.
- Grok context usage refreshes while a turn is running instead of waiting for it to finish.
- Streaming a turn no longer re-renders unchanged history, so long sessions stay responsive while tokens arrive.
- README now has a product story, bilingual roadmap, and demo stills/GIFs of the real interface.
- Process action rows (tools and thoughts) use a quieter verb color until hover.

### Fixed

- Two windows no longer overwrite each other's session list: `index.json` is a cache, record files are the truth, and a deletion in one window wins over a live session in the other. Soft-deleted sessions move to `sessions/trash/` for the undo window. A new session's first write no longer races the index reconcile (that used to toast as if the chat had been deleted elsewhere).
- Kept and newly pasted attachments share one row in the history and queue inline editors.
- A trailing thought or to-do update after the last tool call no longer swallows the reply into the process fold. An opened thought stays visible when the first tool call starts a fold, and question records stay at the point they were asked.
- The send button stays visible if the metal shader never paints a first frame.
- Stale "running" snapshots no longer keep a finished turn on Working.
- Menus near the top of the shell (including the history editor) flip down instead of clipping.
- Hiding the sidebar no longer leaves a still-visible prompt folded as if the history had been compressed.
- Connected rails grow with an opening panel instead of freezing. The working row fades out instead of dropping, and clicking a prompt opens the history editor without a transition so the click lands in the text.
- Empty session-list search stays the height of one item row.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Activity Bar chat view (primary sidebar), plus **Acpira: Open Chat**. The view can be moved to the secondary sidebar from the icon context menu.
- User prompts stick to the top of their exchange and fold to a few lines once stuck, so a long message does not wall off the reply. Click the card to edit (and copy from the editor); hover copy actions are gone.
- Overlay-style scrollbars: the hairline thumb shows while a pane is scrolling or under the pointer, never as a permanent grey bar.
- Model panels use a searchable command list once a catalog is large; menus, switches, radios, dialogs, and toasts share Base UI primitives.

### Changed

- Chat overlays and settings controls share one primitive set (`DropdownMenu`, `Command`, `Switch`, `RadioGroup`, `Dialog`, `Collapsible`). Stylesheets are split into tokens / base / prose / motion / chat with explicit cascade layers.
- Tool rows distinguish queued from in-progress (`Read queued` vs `Read…`). Compaction's live label is just Compacting.
- Context usage caps the ring at the auto-compact threshold when that budget is smaller than the agent's reported window.

### Fixed

- Devin background shells no longer look like a hung generic tool. A parked exec is skipped as current activity; `get_output` / `kill_shell` show as wait/stop on the parked command.
- Opening an attachment uses `vscode.open`, so images and other binaries preview instead of failing as "the file appears to be binary".

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Each sidebar and editor webview now keeps its own active session. Session events go only to viewers showing that conversation; the shared list and process pool stay global.
- New chats reuse a warm, initialize-only agent process. Opening `+` on an empty same-agent session keeps that session instead of killing it, and the composer can accept the first prompt while startup finishes.
- Streamed text fades in per grapheme with a bounded visual backlog and no chunk batching. Live row slots enter in sequence; connected rails attach to icon strokes and end in a short solid dot.

### Changed

- The turn heading owns the only activity orb. Working stays visible across tool changes and fold expansion; thought rows use a static icon plus shimmer; initialization reuses the connecting orb; approval and question waits pause on static icons.
- Permission cards use a compact approvals menu instead of a stacked option list.
- Native reasoning presentation splits on/off from Low / High / Max, so DeepSeek Off is a Thinking switch rather than a radio sibling. Vendor marks resolve from option IDs, so a bare K3 name still brands as Kimi.
- History stays static. Disabled motion and reduced-motion settings also stop rail animations.
- Local `.agents/skills` is ignored in the packaged extension, and the marketplace description is tighter.

### Fixed

- After a Kimi model switch, leftover thinking values the new model does not offer are dropped, and a native thinking id is written so the phantom value does not stay on the wire.
- Empty thought blocks stay hidden. Completed edit diffs keep their stats in every tool-line mode, including collapsed rows.
- Tool generation time is no longer counted as thinking duration.
- A finished to-do dock stays visible only while its own turn is still running; open entries remain pinned across turns. To-do expansion spacing is tighter and no longer jumps when the list updates.
- Account quota is fetched as soon as an account is imported or logged in, without waiting for a session. Settings rows re-read when the account set changes while the page is open. Stored account details no longer include the user name.
- Menu content columns stay aligned when a row is checked.
- The session list popover empty state matches the search field inset, skips the trailing list container so padding stays symmetric, and uses a neutral working spinner.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Renamed the project and extension to Acpira, published as `hotic.acpira`.
- Updated command IDs, settings, client metadata, and repository links to the `acpira` namespace.
- Updated GitHub Release automation to publish the renamed extension to both marketplaces.
- Extension storage and saved credentials use the new identity; earlier development installs require account re-import and settings reconfiguration.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Chat shell in the VS Code / Cursor secondary sidebar that drives official ACP CLIs (`grok agent stdio`, `devin acp`, `kimi acp`) and custom ACP commands.
- Sessions, permission approvals, multi-account logins, image and file attachments, a mid-turn prompt queue, and auto-compaction via `/compact`.
- Plan document cards (preview, View Plan, Build) kept outside the process fold.
- Historical message editing by reconstructing context into a fresh `session/new`.
- Settings for language, default agent, compact threshold, hidden option families, and appearance axes.

### Changed

- Follow-up steer / interrupt and MCP injection settings are not shipped in 1.0; mid-turn sends always queue.
