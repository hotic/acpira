# Acpira

**Native harnesses. One considered interface.**

Bring Grok, Devin, Kimi Code, and other ACP agents into VS Code, Cursor, and IntelliJ IDEA. Keep their execution engines, with clear execution history, inline approvals, and follow-ups that keep work moving.

- **Execution history.** View file reads, code changes, and command output in the conversation.
- **Queue and approvals.** Queue messages while an agent is working, review plans, and approve actions in place.
- **Choose the agent. Keep the interface.** Use Grok, Devin, Kimi Code, and other ACP-compatible CLIs with shared session and model controls.

## Why keep the native agents?

A harness helps determine how much of a model's capability reaches a real task. It runs the agentic loop: calling the model, executing tools, feeding results back, and managing the context for the next step. With the same model, differences in that loop can change task success, cost, and speed.

Acpira connects to agent CLIs through ACP, keeping model calls and execution in the selected agent. Kimi Code runs through `kimi acp`, Devin through `devin acp`, and Grok through `grok agent stdio`. Each CLI continues to own its tools and context compaction.

Acpira handles the interface around that work: code diffs, expandable execution details, to-dos, approvals, and queued follow-ups. These controls stay familiar when switching agents.

## How it works

Acpira lives in the Activity Bar and drives official agent CLIs over [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (JSON-RPC over stdio):

- `grok agent stdio`
- `devin acp`
- `kimi acp`
- `codex-acp`
- `claude-agent-acp`
- any ACP-compatible command (added via the `acpira.agents` setting)

The extension manages the UI, sessions, permission approvals, accounts, and context budget. Model calls, agent execution, and context compaction stay in the CLIs.

Store multiple accounts per agent, paste or drop images, and attach workspace files with `@`. Conversations can live in the sidebar or in editor tabs.

## Install

1. Install the extension from a `.vsix` (**Extensions: Install from VSIX…**) or from the Marketplace once it is published. For IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1 and later, install the plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace or from `acpira-<version>-universal.zip` (**Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…**); the universal package carries Node.js for all supported platforms and supports remote development with different client and backend operating systems. Smaller platform-specific packages remain available on GitHub.
2. Install at least one agent CLI and keep it on `PATH`:
   - [Grok](https://x.ai) — `grok` (`grok agent stdio`)
   - [Devin](https://devin.ai) — `devin` (`devin acp`)
   - [Kimi Code](https://www.kimi.com) — `kimi` (`kimi acp`)
   - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) — `codex-acp` (`npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`)
   - [Claude](https://code.claude.com) — `claude-agent-acp` (`npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`)

   An agent without a CLI is greyed out in the menus; its settings page shows the vendor's install command (copy it, or run it in a terminal from there). Acpira notices a newly installed CLI on its own — no reload needed.
3. Click the Acpira icon in the **Activity Bar** (left). If it is hidden, right-click the Activity Bar and enable **Acpira**. The view can be dragged to the secondary sidebar. In IntelliJ IDEA, open the **Acpira** tool window on the right; its title bar action opens a conversation as an editor tab.

## Get started

1. Install the agent CLI and sign in. Add or switch accounts from the agent menu; see [Accounts](#accounts).
2. Open the Acpira view from the Activity Bar, or run **Acpira: Open Chat**.
3. Choose an agent, mode, and model from the toolbar below the composer, then send a message. Follow-ups sent mid-turn are queued. The square button cancels the current turn.

### Images and files

- Paste or drop images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP, up to 10 MB). They are sent with the message.
- Drag files from Explorer into the composer, or type `@` to search the workspace. The agent reads those files itself. Image files dropped from Explorer are sent as images.
- Text files dropped from the system file manager (up to 256 KB) are embedded in the message. Binary files are not supported.

Sessions, accounts, and secrets live in `~/.acpira` (set `ACPIRA_HOME` to override). Cursor and VS Code share this directory; running both at once may overwrite the session list. After a restart, Acpira resumes the session when the agent allows it; otherwise the transcript remains available as read-only history. When context usage is high, Acpira can send `/compact` automatically; you can also compact from the context panel.

### Accounts

Acpira can store several logins per agent and bind one account to each session. Credentials are supplied when a session starts, so picking a different account starts a new session.

- The lower half of the agent menu lists saved accounts. Pick one to start a new session with it. **Import CLI login** reads the CLI’s existing local login (for Devin, `~/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml`). **Sign in in terminal** runs the agent’s login command in an isolated directory and does not change your existing local login. This also works on remote servers: copy the link and paste the code.
- Secrets are stored in `secrets.json` (file mode 600), not the OS keychain. `accounts.json` keeps metadata such as email and plan. Transcripts store only the account id.
- Each session is bound to one account. A **this session only** option on the sign-in notice (for example Devin’s **Sign in with browser**) authenticates the current process only and is not saved.

Agents without an account list still use their own CLI login.

## Roadmap

- More agent integrations: Antigravity, Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor CLI, Pi, and others through ACP or adapters.
- One place to configure models and sync settings to different agents.
- Shared Skills and MCP management.
- Shared prompts and project instructions across harnesses.
- Longer term: a standalone desktop app.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the planned directions.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build          # host (esbuild) + webview (Vite)
pnpm probe grok     # run initialize + session/new against a CLI directly
pnpm probe devin --import-local "Reply pong"   # via the account layer: import local login → authenticate → one turn
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test
pnpm package        # build a .vsix
cd idea && ./gradlew test buildPlugin verifyPlugin   # IntelliJ plugin; buildMarketplacePlugin for the universal ZIP; buildPluginVariants for manual platform ZIPs
```

Press F5 to launch an Extension Development Host. Logs are in Output → Acpira. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the architecture map and protocol notes.

Stable GitHub Releases can publish the same VSIX to Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX, and the IntelliJ plugin to the JetBrains Marketplace, automatically. See [Publishing Acpira](RELEASING.md) for the one-time credentials and release steps.
